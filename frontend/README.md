# Azure Blob Upload

Front end build using Angular, bootstrap. We have also integrate Ngx-bootstrap but not used much as this is just one page example, from where we are uploading a file and then showing the uploaded file for 2.5 seconds and then displaying all blobs in a table. For now we have used image tag to display all blobs considering that we are uploading the images.

Angular version used. 14.2.1

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
